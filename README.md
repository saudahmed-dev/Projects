# Projects!
These are capstone projects I completed while attending a 14 week Java Bootcamp at Tech Elevator

This capstone was completed at 4 week for of the bootcamp. We were given about 20 lines of code in the VendingMachineCLI.java and Menu.java. My pair and I applied the basics of Object Oriented Programming and class design as well as building our first application that used a CLI to dictate the control flow of the application. Unit testing was done with JUnit.

At week 6 we completed another command line interface but this time we integrated a SQL database using PostgreSQL. We were given the database but wrote the SQL queries that our JDBC used to access the database and wrote all but the 20 lines of given code in the CLI and two methods in the View's Menu.java file. Unit testing and integration testing was done in JUnit.

At week 9 we built our first full-stack application that displayed a list of national parks with their details. A survey link allowed the user to select their favorite park and enter information that we applied server-side validation to. This project involved using MVC principles and utilized Spring for framework running. We used Tomcat as our server. The only thing we were given was an abstract class for integration tests, the pom.xml file, and the database that was used to populate the data on the website using the JDBC. The view was written in JSTL and HTML.  Integration and unit tests were written in JUnit to test the Model and Silenium was used to test the View.
