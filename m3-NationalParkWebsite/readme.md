At week 9 we built our first full-stack application that displayed a list of national parks with their details. A survey link allowed the user to select their favorite park and enter information that we applied server-side validation to. This project involved using MVC principles and utilized the Spring framework. We used Tomcat as our server. The only thing we were given was an abstract class for integration tests, the pom.xml file, and the database that was used to populate the data on the website using the JDBC. The view was written in JSTL and HTML. Integration and unit tests were written in JUnit to test the Model and Silenium was used to test the View.
